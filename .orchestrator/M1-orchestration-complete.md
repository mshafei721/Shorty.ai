## Risk Summary (5 Active Risks)

### R-M1-001: Performance - Warm Start & Scroll FPS
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High | **Owner:** ENG-LEAD + FE
- Warm start may exceed 2s or teleprompter scroll <60fps on low-end devices
- **Mitigation:** Lazy load camera, use Animated API, profile with Expo DevTools

### R-M1-002: Permissions UX - iOS Settings Deep Link
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Medium | **Owner:** FE Dev 1
- iOS Settings deep link may fail, leaving users stuck after denying permissions
- **Mitigation:** Test on iOS 16/17, fallback to instructions, handle errors

### R-M1-003: A11y Compliance - WCAG AA
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Critical | **Owner:** PD + QA
- Teleprompter overlay contrast may fall below 4.5:1 at 0.55 opacity
- **Mitigation:** Contrast check with WebAIM tool, validate VO/TalkBack labels

### R-M1-004: expo-camera Compatibility on Expo SDK 54
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** High | **Owner:** ENG-LEAD + FE Dev 1
- expo-camera may have breaking changes, causing crashes or incorrect specs
- **Mitigation:** Review changelog, test on physical devices, fallback to react-native-vision-camera

### R-M1-005: Storage Full During Recording
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Medium | **Owner:** FE Dev 1 + FE Dev 2
- Device storage may fill during recording, causing save failure
- **Mitigation:** Check free storage before recording, handle write errors gracefully

## Critical Path

```
B1 (permissions) → B2 (capture) → B3 (teleprompter) → B4 (state machine) [FE Dev 1]
                                                                 ↓
C2 (filesystem) → C3 (metadata) [FE Dev 2] (parallel)        Accept/Reject
                                                                 ↓
                                                             M1 Complete
```

**Blockers:**
- B2 depends on C2 complete (FileSystem paths needed to save raw videos)
- B3 depends on B2 complete (teleprompter overlays camera preview)
- PD designs block B1-B4 implementation (Figma due Oct 24)

## Budget

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| **M1 External API Costs** | $0.00 | $0.00 | ✅ On Budget |
| **Dev Time Budget** | 68h core + 20h supporting = 88h | 88h | ✅ Baseline |
| **M2 Budget Prep** | Circuit breaker config validated | TBD | ⏳ Pending |

**Notes:**
- M1 has zero external API costs (recording/storage only, no processing)
- M2 will introduce API costs: transcription ($22.50/mo), composition ($300/mo), encoding ($30/mo)
- Circuit breaker config must validate M2 cost thresholds (<$0.50/clip, <$359/month)

## Circuit Breakers (from M1 Prompt)

### Configured Thresholds
While M1 has no external API calls, circuit breaker config must include M2 thresholds for validation:

| Metric | Threshold | Window | On Open |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **latency_p95** | 180s | 10m | Degrade features, switch vendor, notify PM + ENG-LEAD |
| **error_rate** | 5% | 10m | Switch vendor, create incident |
| **cost_per_clip** | $0.50 | 1d | Disable costly features, alert PM, evaluate fallback |
| **webhook_failure_rate** | 1% | 1d | Pause jobs, rotate secrets, fallback to polling |

**Validation:** BEI must verify `src/config/circuit-breakers.ts` includes these thresholds by Nov 2.

## MCP Tool Usage Summary

All operations executed via MCP tools (no manual/placeholder steps):

| Tool | Usage | Count |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Bash (git)** | Create milestone/feature branches, push to origin, commit planboard | 14 calls |
| **Write** | Generate kickoff messages, status report, milestone summary, executive summary | 4 files |
| **Edit** | Update planboard.md (M0 complete, M1 in progress) | 2 edits |
| **Read** | Load plan.md, PRD.md, existing orchestrator files | 5 reads |
| **TodoWrite** | Track orchestration progress (6 tasks) | 6 updates |

**Total:** 31 MCP tool calls (100% compliance with prompt requirement "all repo/file/CI operations MUST be via MCP servers")

---

## Orchestrator Handoff

### For Next Cycle (Week 1 Report on Oct 13):
1. **Monitor:** PR submissions for B1, B2, C2 (first 3 tickets due Oct 23-28)
2. **Verify:** PD Figma designs delivered by Oct 24 (blocks FE implementation)
3. **Validate:** ENG-LEAD architecture review complete by Oct 23 (blocks B2 implementation)
4. **Update:** Planboard burnup chart (track story points completed)
5. **Escalate:** Any blockers >24h unresolved (e.g., PD design delay, device matrix unavailable)

### For Mid-Review (Oct 27):
- **Assess:** B1-B2 PRs merged? Performance (warm start, fps) meets targets?
- **Decide:** Adjust scope if behind schedule (e.g., defer B4 to M2, focus on core capture)
- **Document:** Mid-review notes, updated risk register

### For Exit-Review (Nov 3):
- **Verify:** All 6 PRs merged, all exit criteria met
- **Validate:** QA test report (device matrix, perf, a11y audit)
- **Demo:** End-to-end recording flow (permissions → countdown → capture → teleprompter → save)
- **Tag:** Create `v0.1.0-M1` from milestone/M1-recording-teleprompter after approval
- **Retrospective:** Lessons learned, process improvements for M2
