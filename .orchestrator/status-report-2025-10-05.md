## Summary
Orchestrator initialized for 10-week MVP delivery (M0-M5). Milestone M0 branch created, memory system operational, CI/CD configured, kickoff messages generated for 9 M0 tickets.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Memory system initialized (`.orchestrator/memory.jsonl`, milestone summaries)
- ✅ M0 milestone branch created: `milestone/M0-foundations`
- ✅ CI/CD workflows configured (typecheck, lint, unit ≥80%, a11y, bundle size)
- ✅ CODEOWNERS file created (ENG-LEAD + QA required approvals)
- ✅ PR template with mandatory sections (Summary, Tests, Risks, Rollback)
- ✅ Kickoff messages generated for all M0 tickets (A0, A1-A4, C1, E1, F1, PM)

**What Changed Since Last Report:**
- First report (initialization)

## Quality Gates

### M0 Gates (All Pending)
| Gate | Target | Status | Value | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Unit Coverage** | ≥80% | ⏳ Pending | N/A | CI configured, awaiting A1 code |
| **Processing p95** | <180s | N/A | N/A | M2 milestone |
| **WER** | <5% | N/A | N/A | M2 milestone (transcription) |
| **Crash Rate** | <5% | ⏳ Pending | N/A | Tracked post-A1 deployment |
| **A11y** | WCAG AA | ⏳ Pending | N/A | A11y lint configured in CI |

**Notes:**
- Processing, WER gates apply starting M2 (POC pipeline)
- M0 focuses on foundation: nav, storage, architecture docs

---

## Budget

### M0 Budget
- **Per-Clip Cost:** $0.00 (no API calls in M0)
- **Monthly Cost:** $0.00 (local dev only)
- **Forecast:** $0.00 (M0 has no external API usage)

### Overall Budget (10-Week Plan)
- **Target Monthly:** ≤$359/mo
- **Target Per-Clip:** ≤$0.50
- **Current Trajectory:** On track (M0-M1 have no API costs)

**Cost Notes:**
- External API costs start in M2 (AssemblyAI, Shotstack, Mux)
- Budget monitoring begins M2 with D1-D8 adapters

## Risks

| ID | Description | Owner | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Trigger |
|----|-------------|-------|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **R-001** | Expo SDK 54 migration issues (incompatible modules, build failures) | ENG-LEAD | Low | High | Test on both iOS/Android early in A1; have rollback to SDK 50 if critical blockers | Build fails on CI after A1 merge |
| **R-002** | Team onboarding delay (agents unfamiliar with Expo/RN) | PM | Medium | Medium | Provide quick-start docs in A0; pair programming for A1-A2 | Tickets slip >2 days past due date |
| **R-003** | Design system delay blocks A2-A4 UI work | PD | Low | Medium | Start E1 immediately (parallel to A0-A1); provide wireframes if Figma delayed | E1 not complete by Oct 11 |

**New Risks:** R-001, R-002, R-003 added during initialization

**Closed Risks:** None yet

## Next Actions

### Top 3 Priorities (Week 1, Oct 7-9)
1. **ENG-LEAD:** Complete A0 (architecture docs, CODEOWNERS, PR template) by Oct 8
   - Blocks A1 and all downstream work
   - Priority: CRITICAL
2. **PD:** Start E1 (design system, 10 M0 screens in Figma) by Oct 7
   - Parallel to A1, but blocks A2-A4 UI implementation
   - Priority: HIGH
3. **FE:** Complete A1 (Expo init, navigation, AsyncStorage v1) by Oct 9
   - Unlocks A2-A4, C1 (entire M0 depends on this)
   - Priority: CRITICAL

### Upcoming Checkpoints
- **Mid-Review:** 2025-10-14 (progress check, unblock team)
- **Exit Review:** 2025-10-20 (go/no-go for M1)
