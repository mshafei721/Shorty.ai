## Risk Register Summary
See `.orchestrator/risks.md` for details.

**Active Risks:**
- **R-001:** Expo SDK 54 migration issues (Low likelihood, High impact)

---

**Next Actions:**
1. ENG-LEAD: Complete A0 (architecture docs, CODEOWNERS, PR template)
2. PD: Complete E1 (design system, 10 M0 screens in Figma)
3. FE: Complete A1 (Expo init, navigation, AsyncStorage v1)
4. FE Dev 2: Kick off A5 (dashboard hub panels + states)
5. FE Dev 1: Begin I1/B5 (AI scripting studio UI, teleprompter rehearsal)
6. PM: Schedule mid-review (Oct 14) & exit review (Oct 20)

### 2025-10-08 Review Notes (Codex)
- [Done] Incorporated into ticket tables and status fields on 2025-10-08; remaining bullets kept for traceability.
- Ticket tables still show every M0 item as pending even though the overall summary claims M0 is complete; update individual statuses and burnup totals to match reality.
- Surface new tickets for the project dashboard hub, AI scripting workspace, sub-niche onboarding refinements, teleprompter control polish, and backend AI pipeline work so they can be tracked explicitly.
- Current milestone header lists M1 as active, but engineering progress indicates several M0/M1 features are unfinished; realign the Current Milestone indicator.
- Add dependency notes for the missing backend pipeline, since frontend previews rely on it; without these blockers tracked the board masks the critical path.
- Refresh hours/story points to reflect added scope (dashboard, AI scripting, pipeline) and reset completion percentages so stakeholders see the true remaining effort.

---
### 2025-10-08 Backlog Additions (Codex)
- [Done] Reflected via A5, A6, I1, I2, B5, D9 tickets and milestone updates above.
**Status Corrections**
- Mark A0‚ÄìA4, C1, and E1 as ‚Äúüîµ In Progress‚Äù until code and design deliverables ship; do not list M0 as complete while tickets remain open.
- Update burnup totals to reflect 0h completed for the above tickets and recalculate completion percentage accordingly.

**New Tickets**
| Ticket | Owner | Due | Status | Exit Criteria | Branch | Notes |
|--------|-------|-----|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| **A5** | FE Dev 2 | Oct 19 | ‚è≥ Pending | Project dashboard hub (Active Videos, AI Drafts, Quick Actions) implemented with empty/loading/error states | feature/app-A5-dashboard-hub | Depends on A3, C1 |
| **A6** | Designer | Oct 17 | ‚è≥ Pending | Dashboard + scripting workspace Figma delivery, including mobile responsive states | feature/design-A6-dashboard-scripting | Links to A5, I1 |
| **I1** | FE Dev 1 | Oct 24 | ‚è≥ Pending | AI scripting studio UI with prompt presets, revision history, teleprompter send flow | feature/app-I1-ai-scripting | Depends on D8 |
| **I2** | Backend Integrator | Oct 24 | ‚è≥ Pending | AI scripting API orchestration with retries and moderation fallback | feature/backend-I2-ai-scripting-api | Depends on vendor credits |
| **B5** | FE Dev 1 | Oct 28 | ‚è≥ Pending | Teleprompter rehearsal mode and multi-take management | feature/capture-B5-teleprompter-rehearsal | Depends on B3 |
| **D9** | Backend Integrator | Nov 17 | ‚è≥ Pending | End-to-end subtitles pipeline (upload ‚Üí transcript ‚Üí burn-in ‚Üí download) running in staging | feature/backend-D9-subtitles-slice | Depends on D1-D6 |

**Milestone Alignment**
- Set ‚ÄúCurrent Milestone‚Äù to M0 until A0‚ÄìA4/C1/E1 reach ‚úÖ; include banner noting backend pipeline is a gating dependency for M2‚ÄìM4.
- Add dependency column entries referencing D9 for M3/M4 tickets so the lack of a real pipeline is visible.
