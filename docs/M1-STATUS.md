**Files:**
- `src/features/recording/fsm/recordingMachine.ts`
- `src/features/recording/fsm/__tests__/recordingMachine.test.ts`

---

- `src/features/recording/api/videoMetadata.ts`
- `src/features/recording/api/__tests__/videoMetadata.test.ts`

---

### useRecording Hook (100%)
**Commits:** 53d3567, 54eff95
**Coverage:** 95.55% (13 tests passing)

- Bridges FSM with React components
- Auto-countdown (3s) before recording starts

### B3: Teleprompter Overlay (100%)
**Commits:** 26d1903
**Coverage:** 82.35% (20 tests passing)

- Auto-scroll based on WPM (60-220, default 140)
- Font size controls (12-32pt, default 18pt)
- Play/pause with recording state sync
- Rewind to beginning
- Show/hide controls toggle
- Semi-transparent overlay (55% opacity)

**Files:**
- `src/features/recording/components/TeleprompterOverlay.tsx`
- `src/features/recording/components/__tests__/TeleprompterOverlay.test.tsx`

---

### B2: Camera Preview UI (95%)
**Commits:** 693afd2, c45d430
**Coverage:** 100% (29 tests passing)

**Completed:**
- Recording state displays (idle/recording/paused)
- Timer with mm:ss formatting
- Warning indicator when ≤15s remaining
- Start/pause/resume/stop controls
- Visual state indicators (red/orange dots)
- Portrait placeholder (1080×1920 @ 30fps)

**Remaining:**
- Actual expo-camera integration (placeholder UI only)
- Video capture to FileSystem
- 1080x1920@30fps enforcement at camera API level

**Files:**
- `src/features/recording/components/CameraPreview.tsx`
- `src/features/recording/components/__tests__/CameraPreview.test.tsx`

---

### RecordScreen Integration (100%)
**Commits:** c45d430

- Connected useRecording hook to UI
- Layered TeleprompterOverlay over CameraPreview
- FSM state drives both components
- Sample script for testing
- TypeScript fully typed with no errors

**Files:**
- `src/screens/RecordScreen.tsx`

---

### Telemetry Event Wiring (100%)
**Commits:** 54eff95

**Events tracked:**
- `record_started`: When countdown completes & recording begins
- `record_paused`: When user pauses recording
- `record_resumed`: When user resumes from pause
- `record_completed`: On successful save with duration
- `record_cancelled`: On stop, abort, or error (with reason)

All events include:
- Timestamp (ISO8601)
- Context (projectId, videoId, scriptId where applicable)
- Duration for completed recordings

---

## ⏳ Remaining Work (5%)

### B2: Actual Camera Integration
**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours

Tasks:
1. Replace placeholder with `<Camera>` from expo-camera
2. Implement video recording with `recordAsync()`
3. Enforce 1080x1920@30fps in camera config
4. Save recordings to `FileSystem.documentDirectory/videos/raw/{projectId}/`
5. Wire start/stop/pause/resume to expo-camera API
6. Handle camera errors and add to FSM error state

---

### Documentation Updates
**Estimated effort:** 1 hour

Tasks:
1. Update README.md with M1 features
2. Add TESTING.md section for recording tests
3. Create ADR for FSM architecture decision
4. Document telemetry events in analytics docs

---
