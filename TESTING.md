## Manual Testing Options

### Option 1: Expo Go on Real Device (RECOMMENDED)

**Why:** Best reflects production user experience

**Steps:**
1. Install Expo Go app on your phone
   - iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
   - Android: [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

2. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Scan QR code with:
   - **iOS:** Camera app
   - **Android:** Expo Go app

4. Test flows:
   - ✅ Splash screen (2s delay)
   - ✅ Niche Selection (stub)
   - ✅ Projects List (empty state)
   - ✅ Settings screen

### Option 2: iOS Simulator (Mac Only)

**Requirements:** Xcode installed

**Steps:**
```bash
npm start
# Press 'i' when Metro bundler starts
```

**Test same flows as Option 1**

### Option 3: Android Emulator

**Requirements:** Android Studio + emulator configured

**Steps:**
```bash
npm start
# Press 'a' when Metro bundler starts
```

**Test same flows as Option 1**

## Chrome DevTools Testing (NOT SUPPORTED)

### Why Chrome DevTools Doesn't Work

**Issue:** Expo SDK 54 is **mobile-first** and has dependency conflicts with web:

```
react-native-web requires react@^18 || ^19
react-dom@19 requires react@^19.1
Expo SDK 54 uses react@18.3.1
```

**Conflict:** Installing web dependencies breaks the mobile app.

**Decision:** M0 is a **mobile-only** foundation. Web support deferred to post-MVP.

### Alternative: React Native Debugger

If you need browser-like debugging:

1. Install React Native Debugger:
   - [Download](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/releases)

2. Enable debugging in Expo:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Press 'd' → "Debug remote JS"
   ```

3. Open React Native Debugger:
   - View console logs
   - Inspect React component tree
   - Monitor AsyncStorage
   - View network requests

## Verification Checklist (M0 Exit Criteria)

### ✅ Automated Tests
- [x] 23 unit tests pass
- [x] TypeScript compiles (0 errors)
- [x] ESLint clean (0 errors)
- [x] 80%+ coverage on storage utilities

### ✅ Architecture
- [x] Navigation system configured (Onboarding → Main)
- [x] AsyncStorage schema v1 defined
- [x] API adapter interfaces documented
- [x] Circuit breaker configs defined

### ✅ Code Quality
- [x] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [x] All imports resolve correctly
- [x] No merge conflicts
- [x] Git history clean (linear)

### ⏳ Manual Testing (Requires Device/Simulator)
- [ ] Splash screen loads (2s delay)
- [ ] Navigation works (Splash → Niche → Projects)
- [ ] Settings screen displays app version
- [ ] App doesn't crash on launch
- [ ] AsyncStorage persists data (relaunch test)

---

## Known Limitations (M0)

### Not Implemented Yet (Expected)
These are **planned for M1-M5**, not bugs:

- ❌ **Camera recording** (M1)
- ❌ **Teleprompter overlay** (M1)
- ❌ **Projects CRUD** (M1 - stubs exist)
- ❌ **Niche selection UI** (M1 - stubs exist)
- ❌ **Video processing** (M2)

### Web Support
- ❌ **Web browser testing:** Deferred to post-MVP
- ❌ **Chrome DevTools:** Not compatible with current Expo setup
- ⚠️ **`npm run web`:** Requires additional dependencies (conflicts with mobile)

### Expected Behavior
- **Stub screens:** Show placeholder text (intentional - UI in M1)
- **Empty states:** Projects list shows "No projects yet" (correct)
- **No data persistence:** Onboarding doesn't save selection yet (M1 feature)

## M1 Recording & Teleprompter Testing

### Automated Tests (94 passing)

**CameraPreview Component (29 tests)**
- Idle state: Renders camera view, shows start button, no timer/indicator
- Recording state: Shows REC indicator, timer, pause/stop buttons
- Paused state: Shows PAUSED indicator, resume/stop buttons
- Timer formatting: Zero time, seconds only, minutes:seconds, max duration
- Warning indicator: Shows at ≤15s remaining, correct remaining time, no negative values
- Recording indicator styles: Red dot when recording, orange when paused
- Timer warning styles: White >15s, red ≤15s remaining
- Button interactions: onStartPress, onStopPress, onPausePress, onResumePress called correctly

**useRecording Hook (28 tests)**
- FSM transitions: Idle → Countdown → Recording → Reviewing
- Pause/Resume: Recording ↔ Paused transitions
- Auto-stop: Enforces 120s max duration
- Timer: Elapsed time tracking, accuracy validation
- Error handling: Invalid transitions blocked
- Cleanup: Stops timer on unmount

**useTeleprompter Hook (27 tests)**
- State transitions: Hidden → VisiblePaused ↔ Scrolling → Completed
- WPM calculation: Converts WPM to scroll speed (80-200 range)
- Sentence highlighting: Current (80%), upcoming (50%), past (30%) brightness
- Scroll position: Tracks progress, detects completion
- Controls: Play, pause, restart, speed adjustment
- Edge cases: Empty text, single sentence, boundary conditions

**Telemetry Service (10 tests)**
- Event tracking: recordingStarted, recordingCompleted, recordingCancelled, recordingPaused, recordingResumed
- Data storage: Saves to AsyncStorage under `analytics` key
- 30-day rotation: Purges events older than 30 days
- Metrics aggregation: Total duration, pause/resume counts
- Privacy: Local storage only, no network calls

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Camera Integration (Requires Physical Device)**
- [ ] Camera permissions requested on first use
- [ ] "Open Settings" deep link works if permissions denied (iOS/Android)
- [ ] CameraView renders back camera feed
- [ ] Video quality: 1080x1920 portrait, 30fps
- [ ] Recording controls respond within 500ms
- [ ] 120s auto-stop triggers correctly
- [ ] Storage warning appears if <500MB free

**Teleprompter Overlay**
- [ ] Overlay displays at 55% opacity over camera
- [ ] Text scrolls smoothly without jank
- [ ] WPM adjustment (80-200) affects scroll speed
- [ ] Font size toggle (S/M/L) updates immediately
- [ ] Sentence highlighting shows correct brightness levels
- [ ] Play/Pause/Restart controls work
- [ ] Completes at end of script

**State Machine Behavior**
- [ ] Recording FSM: Idle → Countdown(3s) → Recording
- [ ] Pause: Recording → Paused, timer stops
- [ ] Resume: Paused → Recording, timer continues
- [ ] Stop: Any state → Reviewing
- [ ] Restart: Reviewing → Idle
- [ ] Invalid transitions blocked (no crash)

**Telemetry**
- [ ] Events written to AsyncStorage after each recording
- [ ] Data persists across app restarts
- [ ] 30-day rotation removes old events
- [ ] No network calls made (fully local)

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail After Changes
```bash
npm test -- --clearCache
npm test
```

### TypeScript Errors Appear
```bash
# Verify dependencies installed correctly
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Expo Won't Start
```bash
# Clear cache
npx expo start --clear

# If port conflict
npx kill-port 8081
npm start
```

### Can't Connect to Expo Go
- Ensure phone and computer on **same WiFi**
- Disable VPN/firewall temporarily
- Use **tunnel mode** if WiFi restricted:
  ```bash
  npx expo start --tunnel
  ```

## CI/CD Testing (GitHub Actions)

**When you push to GitHub**, CI automatically runs:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
✅ TypeScript type check
✅ ESLint
✅ Unit tests (≥80% coverage)
✅ Accessibility lint
✅ Bundle size check (<10MB)
```

**Status:** CI config ready, not yet pushed to GitHub.

## Summary

### What Works ✅
- Automated tests (23 passing)
- TypeScript compilation (0 errors)
- ESLint (0 errors)
- App structure & navigation
- AsyncStorage schema

### What Requires Manual Testing ⏳
- Navigation flows on real device
