# Developer Review: Shorty.ai MVP Progress

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Reviewed by:** Gemini

## 1. Executive Summary

This review assesses the current state of the Shorty.ai MVP against the project's planning and requirements documents.

The primary finding is a significant discrepancy between the project's documentation and the actual state of the codebase. Your assessment that **Milestones M0 through M3 are substantially complete is largely correct**, based on the existing file structure. The codebase contains implemented components for foundations, recording, a processing gateway, and feature preview screens.

However, the **`.orchestrator/planboard.md` is severely outdated** and incorrectly reports project status, showing 0% completion for most milestones. This document should be updated immediately to reflect the true progress.

The feeling that the app is "missing a lot of things" is also accurate. This stems from two key areas:
1.  **The M2 Illusion:** The core video processing pipeline (Milestone M2, Epic D) has not been implemented on the backend. The frontend connects to a **mock gateway** (`MockM2Gateway.ts`), which gives the *appearance* of functionality but does not perform any actual video editing. This is the single largest gap.
2.  **Missing Polish and Edge Cases:** Many specific UI controls, error-handling states, and non-functional requirements detailed in the `PRD.md` have not been implemented yet, leaving the app feeling incomplete.

Additionally, multiple flagship experiences expected for a “one-stop shop” short-form platform—**a project dashboard, sub-niche-aware onboarding, AI-assisted scripting, a production-ready teleprompter workflow, and end-to-end AI video editing**—are either missing or represented only by skeletal placeholders.

This review provides a detailed gap analysis and recommends prioritizing the backend pipeline development while addressing the missing frontend features.

## 2. Project Status Reconciliation

| Source | Status Assessment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Your Assessment** | M0-M3 complete. |
| **`planboard.md`** | M0 "complete" (with contradictory pending tickets), M1 in progress, M2-M3 pending. Overall 0% complete. |
| **Codebase Reality** | **This is the source of truth.** Significant implementation exists for M0 (foundations), M1 (recording), M2 (a mock gateway), and M3 (feature selection/preview). |

**Conclusion:** The `planboard.md` is unreliable and must be updated. The codebase confirms that frontend work for M0-M3 is well underway.

## 3. Milestone-by-Milestone Gap Analysis

This section compares the requirements from `PRD.md` and `plan.md` to the implemented code.

### Milestone 0: Foundations

- **Requirements (A2, A3, C1):** Onboarding with niche selection, Project CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with soft-delete, and a versioned AsyncStorage schema.
- **Implementation Status:**
  - `src/screens/NicheSelectionScreen.tsx`
  - `src/screens/ProjectsListScreen.tsx`
  - `src/storage/schema.ts`
  - `__tests__/storage/schema.test.ts`
- **Gap Analysis & Missing Pieces:**
  - **[HIGH] Sub-Niche Selection:** The PRD requires selecting both a niche and a sub-niche. The implementation appears to cover only the niche.
  - **[HIGH] Project Dashboard:** There is no consolidated project dashboard that surfaces active projects, recent renders, AI scripts, and quick actions. The PRD positions this as the hub of the product.
  - **[MEDIUM] Project Edit/Delete:** The `ProjectsListScreen.tsx` implies a list view, but it's unclear if full CRUD (edit, **soft delete**) functionality is implemented as per Ticket A3.
  - **[LOW] AsyncStorage Persistence:** While schemas are defined, confirmation is needed that selections and project data are correctly persisted and retrieved across app sessions.

### Milestone 1: Recording + Teleprompter

- **Requirements (B1-B4, C2-C3):** Camera/mic permissions, 1080p video capture, teleprompter with adjustable controls, recording state machine, and local file management.
- **Implementation Status:**
  - `src/features/recording/fsm/recordingMachine.ts`
  - `src/features/recording/components/CameraPreview.tsx`
  - `src/features/recording/components/TeleprompterOverlay.tsx`
  - `src/screens/RecordScreen.tsx`
  - `src/storage/fileSystem.ts`
- **Gap Analysis & Missing Pieces:**
  - **[HIGH] Teleprompter Controls:** The PRD (Section 10) specifies user controls for **WPM (Words Per Minute), font size, and opacity**. These controls appear to be missing from the UI.
  - **[HIGH] Teleprompter Scripting Integration:** There is no workflow that brings AI-generated scripts directly into the teleprompter, nor a scripting workspace to iterate before recording.
  - **[HIGH] Storage Checks:** The plan requires warning users when storage is low (<500MB free). This critical check seems to be absent.
  - **[MEDIUM] Recording State Machine Polish:** The `recordingMachine.ts` exists, but does it handle all states from the PRD (e.g., `Reviewing`, `ReadyForFeatures`) and edge cases like permissions being revoked mid-session?
  - **[LOW] File Management:** `fileSystem.ts` exists, but confirmation is needed that it correctly handles the full lifecycle (raw, processed, temp files) and cleanup as per Ticket C2.

### Milestone 2: Processing Pipeline POC

- **Requirements (D1-D8):** A full backend pipeline to upload a video and apply automated edits using external vendors (AssemblyAI for transcription, Shotstack for composition, etc.).
- **Implementation Status:**
  - `src/features/m3/gateway/M2Gateway.ts`
  - `src/features/m3/gateway/MockM2Gateway.ts`
  - `src/features/m3/__tests__/MockM2Gateway.test.ts`
- **Gap Analysis & Missing Pieces:**
  - **[CRITICAL] No Backend Implementation:** This is the most significant gap in the project. The implementation is a **mock gateway on the frontend**. There is no evidence of the actual backend service that orchestrates API calls to vendors. The app cannot perform its core function—automated video editing—without this. All tickets in Epic D (D1-D8) are effectively not started.
  - **[CRITICAL] AI Video Editing Pipeline:** Beyond the absence of the backend, there is no configurable AI-driven editing flow (auto cuts, B-roll, hook/outro templates) that differentiates the product from a basic editor.

### Milestone 3: Feature Selection & Preview

- **Requirements:** A screen to toggle features (subtitles, filler-word removal), a screen to show processing progress, and a preview player for the final video.
- **Implementation Status:**
  - `src/features/m3/screens/FeaturesScreen.tsx`
  - `src/features/m3/screens/PreviewScreen.tsx`
  - `src/features/m3/state/previewMachine.ts`
- **Gap Analysis & Missing Pieces:**
  - **[HIGH] Processing Status UI:** The PRD requires a dedicated status screen showing progress (`Queued`/`Processing`) and a `Cancel` option. This UI appears to be missing.
  - **[MEDIUM] Feature Toggle Completeness:** The `FeaturesScreen.tsx` exists, but it's unclear if it includes all features specified in the PRD (subtitles, background change, music, intro/outro, filler-word removal) and their associated sub-settings.
  - **[MEDIUM] Error Handling in Preview:** The PRD requires the `PreviewScreen` to handle processing errors and offer a "Retry Processing" option. This functionality needs to be verified.

## 4. Addressing the "Feeling of Incompleteness"

The app feels incomplete because the central user journey is broken at its most critical step.

1.  **The Backend is Missing:** Users can record a video (M1) and select features (M3), but the bridge between them (M2) is a mock. The core value proposition of automated editing does not exist yet. This is why, despite having a lot of UI built, the app doesn't *do* what it's supposed to do.

2.  **Key User Interactions Are Absent:** The lack of smaller, but important, features contributes to the unpolished feel:
    - **No Teleprompter Control:** Users cannot adjust the teleprompter to their reading speed, which is a core part of the recording experience.
    - **No AI Scripting Workspace:** The app does not yet offer a space to brainstorm, outline, and iterate on scripts with AI assistance before recording.
    - **No Safety Nets:** The absence of storage warnings or comprehensive in-app error states (e.g., for network loss, API failures) makes the app feel brittle.
    - **Incomplete User Flows:** The path from recording to a final, shareable video is not fully implemented, lacking the crucial processing and error-handling steps.

## 5. Recommendations & Next Steps

1.  **Update the Planboard:** Immediately update `.orchestrator/planboard.md` to reflect the actual status of the codebase. Mark implemented tickets as "Done" and re-evaluate timelines. This will provide clarity for everyone involved.

2.  **Prioritize the Backend Pipeline (Epic D):** The **highest priority** must be the design and implementation of the backend processing service. All frontend work is ultimately blocked by the absence of a real M2 pipeline.
    - **Action:** Begin work on tickets D1 (Upload Adapter) and D6 (Job Orchestration) to lay the foundation for the backend service.

3.  **Build One End-to-End "Slice":** Instead of building all features at once, focus on getting **one feature working end-to-end**.
    - **Recommendation:** Implement the "Subtitles" feature completely. This involves:
        1. Frontend: `FeaturesScreen` toggle.
        2. Backend: Upload video, call AssemblyAI for transcription, burn subtitles into the video using Shotstack, and provide a download URL.
        3. Frontend: Poll for status, download the processed video, and display it in the `PreviewScreen`.
    - This will prove the entire architecture and provide a massive confidence boost.

4.  **Address Frontend Gaps:** Create and prioritize tickets for the missing frontend features identified in the gap analysis:
    - **High Priority:** Teleprompter controls (WPM, font size), storage warnings, processing status UI.
    - **Medium Priority:** Full Project CRUD, project dashboard data surfacing, sub-niche selection, AI scripting workspace, preview screen error handling.

## 6. Missing Feature Pillars (Product Vision)

Shorty.ai is positioned as a “one-stop shop” for short-form creators, but several cornerstone experiences are absent:

- **Project Dashboard Hub:** Needs an overview of active projects, AI script drafts, teleprompter-ready scripts, and recent renders for quick navigation.
- **Sub-Niche Onboarding:** The onboarding flow must capture both niche and sub-niche choices to tailor scripts, suggestions, and templates.
- **AI Scripting Studio:** Requires prompts, outlines, rewriting tools, and direct export into the teleprompter for seamless recording sessions.
- **Teleprompter Production Flow:** Needs adjustable controls, real-time script injection, and rehearsal/re-take tooling to reduce friction before recording.
- **End-to-End AI Video Editing:** Must deliver automated edits (cuts, captions, music, layout templates) powered by the backend pipeline, plus review/edit loops on the frontend.

By focusing on the backend and methodically closing the gaps on the frontend, the project will move from feeling incomplete to demonstrating real, end-to-end value.
