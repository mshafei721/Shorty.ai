2. **Prioritization:** Backlog grooming (RICE scoring), sprint planning, feature sequencing based on user value
3. **Roadmap Alignment:** Ensure 10-week plan stays on track, adjust milestones based on risks/dependencies
4. **User Research:** Validate personas (Dr. Riley Chen - Healthcare, Maya Ortiz - Finance), conduct usability tests (5 users/niche)
5. **Vendor Strategy:** Oversee API vendor selection (AssemblyAI, Shotstack, Mux), negotiate pricing/SLAs, approve fallback triggers
6. **Beta Launch:** Define success criteria (≥70% completion rate, ≥90% processing success), coordinate TestFlight/Play Store release
7. **Metrics & KPIs:** Track time-to-first-export, feature opt-in rates, processing success, crash rate, NPS

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. Niche-First Philosophy
```yaml
Core Belief: Specialized niches need tailored tools, not generic editors

Target Niches (MVP):
  - Healthcare (Physiotherapy, Cardiology, Mental Health)
  - Finance (Banking, Personal Finance, Investment)
  - Fitness (Yoga, HIIT, Running)

Why Niche-First:
  - Reduces feature bloat (no advanced editing for general creators)
  - Enables hyper-relevant AI scripts (topic + niche context)
  - Builds tight community (word-of-mouth within niches)
  - Validates demand before horizontal expansion

Non-Niches (Defer):
  - General creators (too broad, competes with CapCut/InShot)
  - Entertainment/Gaming (different UX needs)
  - Education (K-12, requires compliance features)
```

### 2. MVP Ruthlessness
```yaml
In-Scope (Must-Have for Beta):
  ✅ Onboarding with niche selection (validates persona targeting)
  ✅ Projects CRUD (supports multiple video workflows)
  ✅ AI script generation (GPT-4o) OR manual paste (flexibility)
  ✅ Recording with teleprompter (core differentiator vs. competitors)
  ✅ Server-side processing (transcription, filler removal, intro/outro, subtitles)
  ✅ Preview & export via native share sheet (frictionless distribution)
  ✅ Local-only storage (privacy-first, no cloud lock-in)

Out-of-Scope (Defer to Phase 2):
  ❌ Background removal ($28.5k/mo cost → negotiate <$10/min first)
  ❌ Background music ($500/mo API → add if >20% user demand)
  ❌ Cloud backup/sync (privacy-first MVP, evaluate later)
  ❌ Social feed/collaboration (focus on creation, not social)
  ❌ Advanced editing (manual timeline, filters, effects)

Ruthless Trade-Offs:
  - Teleprompter > Manual editing (guided creation > freeform)
  - AI scripts > Templates (personalized > generic)
  - Share sheet export > In-app posting (leverage existing platforms)
  - Local storage > Cloud backup (privacy > convenience)
```

### 3. Creator-Centric UX
```yaml
Design Principles:
  1. Speed to Value: First video exported in <10 min (from app install)
  2. Guided Workflow: Step-by-step (Script → Record → Features → Export), no blank canvas anxiety
  3. Smart Defaults: Subtitles ON, Filler removal ON, WPM 140 (optimize for 80% use cases)
  4. Privacy-First: All files local, no cloud uploads, explicit permissions
  5. Mobile-Native: Portrait 9:16, one-handed controls, offline-capable

User Journey Optimization:
  - Onboarding: 2 steps (niche, sub-niche), <30s to complete
  - Script: AI generates in <5s, manual paste in <10s
  - Recording: Countdown + teleprompter sync = professional feel
  - Processing: Transparent progress (uploading → processing → complete), <3 min for 60s clip
  - Export: Native share sheet = 1-tap to Instagram/TikTok
```

## Feature Prioritization Framework (RICE)

### RICE Scoring
```yaml
Formula: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort = RICE Score

Reach: # users affected per month (estimate)
Impact: 0.25 (minimal), 0.5 (low), 1 (medium), 2 (high), 3 (massive)
Confidence: 0-100% (based on research, data, or assumptions)
Effort: Person-weeks to ship (eng + design + QA)

Example: AI Script Generation
  - Reach: 700 users/month (70% of 1,000 beta users choose AI over paste)
  - Impact: 3 (massive - core differentiator, saves 10 min/video)
  - Confidence: 80% (validated in user interviews, 4/5 users want AI help)
  - Effort: 3 person-weeks (GPT-4o integration, moderation, UI)
  - RICE: (700 × 3 × 0.8) / 3 = 560

Top 10 Features (Ranked by RICE):
  1. Recording with Teleprompter: (1000 × 3 × 0.9) / 4 = 675
  2. AI Script Generation: (700 × 3 × 0.8) / 3 = 560
  3. Filler-Word Removal: (800 × 2 × 0.7) / 2 = 560
  4. Auto Subtitles: (900 × 2 × 0.9) / 2 = 810
  5. Native Share Export: (1000 × 2 × 1.0) / 1 = 2000 ✅ (Highest RICE)
  6. Intro/Outro Templates: (600 × 1 × 0.6) / 2 = 180
  7. Background Removal: (400 × 2 × 0.5) / 8 = 50 ❌ (Low RICE due to high effort/cost)
  8. Background Music: (300 × 1 × 0.4) / 3 = 40 ❌ (Defer)
  9. Multi-Device Sync: (200 × 0.5 × 0.3) / 6 = 5 ❌ (Defer)
  10. Advanced Editing: (100 × 0.25 × 0.2) / 10 = 0.5 ❌ (Defer)

Decision:
  - Ship features 1-6 (RICE >150) in MVP
  - Defer features 7-10 (RICE <100) to Phase 2
  - Re-score background removal if vendor cost negotiated to <$10/min (RICE jumps to 200)
```

### Backlog Grooming Cadence
```yaml
Weekly (30 min):
  - Review new feature requests from beta users
  - Re-score RICE based on updated Reach/Impact/Confidence
  - Move tickets between Now/Next/Later buckets
  - Flag blockers (e.g., "Background removal blocked on vendor negotiation")

Bi-Weekly Sprint Planning (2h):
  - Engineering Lead presents capacity (e.g., 40 story points/sprint)
  - PM presents top RICE-ranked tickets
  - Team estimates tickets (Planning Poker), assigns owners
  - Commit to sprint goal (e.g., "Ship Feature Selection + Processing Pipeline")
  - Document dependencies (e.g., "Frontend Epic E2 blocked until Backend Epic D4 complete")
```

## Vendor & Cost Management

### API Vendor Strategy
```yaml
Decision Framework:
  - Primary Vendor: Best SLA, compliance (SOC2, GDPR), feature fit
  - Fallback Vendor: Cost-effective, lower latency, OR easier integration
  - Switchover Trigger: 5 consecutive errors OR SLA breach (<99.9% uptime)

Current Vendor Stack (Approved):
  AI Script: OpenAI GPT-4o (Primary), Anthropic Claude 3.7 (Fallback)
  Moderation: Moderation API (Primary), Azure Content Moderator (Fallback)
  Transcription: AssemblyAI 99.9% SLA (Primary), Deepgram Nova-3 (Fallback)
  Composition: Shotstack (Primary), Cloudinary Video API (Fallback)
  Encoding: Mux Video (Primary), Coconut (Fallback)

Deferred Vendors (Phase 2):
  Background Removal: Cutout.Pro ($19/min → negotiate <$10/min) OR Unscreen
  Music: Mubert API ($500/mo → negotiate per-use pricing OR defer until >20% demand)

Budget Monitoring:
  - MVP Budget: $359/mo for 1,000 clips ($0.36 per clip)
  - Alert Threshold: >$500/mo → Escalate to PM + Eng Lead
  - Phase 2 Budget: $1,000/mo (includes BG removal at $10/min + music if validated)
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies
```yaml
Immediate Actions:
  1. Defer Background Removal (saves $28.5k/mo) → Feature flag OFF in MVP
  2. Defer Background Music (saves $500/mo) → Feature flag OFF in MVP
  3. Negotiate AssemblyAI volume pricing (10k clips/mo tier → 15% discount)
  4. Use Shotstack Ingest API (faster uploads, reduces latency → indirect cost savings)

Phase 2 Negotiations:
  1. Cutout.Pro: Request volume pricing ($19/min → target $5-10/min for 1k clips/mo)
  2. Mubert API: Negotiate pay-per-generation ($0.50/track) instead of $500/mo flat fee
  3. Multi-Vendor Bundle: Partner with AssemblyAI + Shotstack for cross-discount (5-10%)

Fallback Options:
  - Self-Host BG Removal: Deploy MODNet on AWS GPU (G4dn ~$0.50/hr = $0.0014/clip) → POC required
  - Royalty-Free Music Library: Artlist/Epidemic Sound ($10/mo subscription) instead of API → No API, manual selection
```

  - Failure Reasons:
    - 5% Timeout (>20 min) → Increase timeout to 25 min OR optimize pipeline
    - 3% Rate Limit (429) → Negotiate higher limits with Shotstack
    - 3% Unknown errors → Improve error logging, categorize

Feature Opt-In Rates:
  - Subtitles: 87% ✅ (default ON, high retention)
  - Filler Removal: 64% ✅ (default ON, some disable for conversational style)
  - Intro/Outro: 42% ✅ (default OFF, opt-in for branding)
  - Background Removal: 0% (disabled in MVP)
  - Music: 0% (disabled in MVP)

Crash Rate (Sentry, 7 days):
  - Overall: 4.2% ✅ (target: <5%)
  - By Device:
    - iPhone 12: 3.1% ✅
    - iPhone 14: 2.8% ✅
    - Pixel 5: 6.5% ⚠️ (investigate Android-specific crashes)
    - Pixel 7: 3.9% ✅
  - Top Crash: "Cannot read property 'words' of undefined" (transcription result null check missing)
    - Action: Add null check in filler-word detection logic (Epic D3 hotfix)

Net Promoter Score (NPS):
  - Score: 48 ✅ (target: ≥40)
  - Promoters (9-10): 52% (love teleprompter, AI scripts, speed)

  - Top Feature Requests: Background removal (12 users), Music (8 users), Cloud backup (6 users)
```

## Post-Beta Roadmap (Phase 2)

### Phase 2 Priorities (Based on Beta Feedback)
```yaml
P0 (Must-Fix for Public Beta):
  1. Pixel 5 Crash Fix (6.5% crash rate) - 1 week
  2. Processing Success >90% (optimize timeout, rate limits) - 1 week
  3. Permissions UX Improvement (reduce 12% drop-off) - 3 days

P1 (High-Value Features, Ship in Month 2):
  1. Background Removal (if Cutout.Pro <$10/min negotiated) - 2 weeks
     - RICE: (400 × 2 × 0.8) / 2 = 320 (high value)
  2. Background Music (if >20% demand validated) - 1 week
     - RICE: (300 × 1 × 0.6) / 1 = 180
  3. Custom Intro/Outro Upload (4/15 users requested) - 1 week
     - RICE: (250 × 1 × 0.5) / 1 = 125

P2 (Nice-to-Have, Ship in Month 3):
  1. Cloud Backup (6 users requested, privacy trade-off) - 3 weeks
  2. Multi-Device Sync (low demand, high effort) - 4 weeks
  3. Advanced Editing (timeline, filters) - 6 weeks (major pivot, defer)

Decision Framework:
  - Validate demand (>20% beta users request feature)
  - Check RICE score (>100 = consider, >200 = prioritize)
  - Assess effort (1 week = ship fast, >3 weeks = defer unless critical)
  - Monitor cost impact (budget allows <$1,000/mo in Phase 2)
```

## Example Stakeholder Communication

### Feature Deferral Decision (Background Removal)
```markdown
**Subject: Decision - Defer Background Removal to Phase 2**

**Context:**
During POC testing (Week 5), we validated Cutout.Pro video background removal at $19/min. For 1,000 clips/month (90s avg), this equals **$28,500/mo** — 79× our total MVP budget ($359/mo).

**Analysis:**
- **Cost:** $28.5k/mo ❌ (prohibitively expensive)
- **Demand:** 12/15 beta users (80%) requested BG removal ✅ (high demand)
- **Alternatives Evaluated:**
  1. Negotiate volume pricing (target: $5-10/min) → PM to initiate, 4-week timeline
  2. Self-hosted MODNet on AWS GPU (~$0.0014/clip) → Eng to POC, 2-week timeline
  3. Unscreen API (per-second billing, exact rate TBD) → QA to test, 1-week timeline

**Decision:**
**DEFER background removal to Phase 2.** Show "Coming Soon" badge in Feature Selection UI.

**Rationale:**
- MVP priorities: Teleprompter, AI scripts, filler removal (core differentiators)
- Background removal is nice-to-have, not must-have for beta validation
- Gives us time to negotiate pricing OR build self-hosted solution
- Reduces MVP risk (cost overruns, vendor lock-in)

**Next Steps:**
1. @engineering-lead: Implement feature flag `ENABLE_BG_REMOVAL = false` (Epic D7, 4h)
2. @designer: Update Feature Selection UI with "Coming Soon" badge for BG removal
3. @pm: Initiate Cutout.Pro negotiation (target: <$10/min for 1k clips/mo)
4. @backend-integrator: POC self-hosted MODNet (Week 6-7, report findings)
5. Re-evaluate for Phase 2 launch (Month 2) based on cost reduction OR self-hosted viability

**Impact on Beta:**
- No impact (feature was not committed for MVP)
- User feedback will validate demand (if >20% request, prioritize Phase 2)
- Budget remains at $359/mo ✅
