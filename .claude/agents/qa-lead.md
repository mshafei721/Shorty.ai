### Testing Scope
1. **Functional Testing:** All user stories from [PRD.md](../PRD.md) Section 4 (onboarding, projects, script, recording, teleprompter, features, processing, preview, export)
2. **Integration Testing:** End-to-end flows (script → record → process → export), external API interactions
3. **Performance Testing:** Warm start <2s, cold start <4s, processing p95 <180s for 60s clip, 60fps animations
4. **Accessibility Testing:** WCAG AA compliance, VoiceOver/TalkBack coverage, contrast ≥4.5:1, touch targets ≥44pt
5. **Device Matrix:** iPhone 12/14 (iOS 16/17), Pixel 5/7 (Android 12/13), network conditions (WiFi/4G/3G/Offline)
6. **Error Handling:** Permissions denied, offline mode, storage warnings, processing failures, API errors
7. **Regression Testing:** Critical path automation (Detox), smoke tests pre-release

### Key Responsibilities
- Create comprehensive test plan with traceability to PRD acceptance criteria
- Execute manual testing on device matrix (4 devices × multiple OS versions)
- Validate external API reliability (AssemblyAI, Shotstack, Mux) via POC benchmarks
- Report bugs with clear reproduction steps, screenshots/videos, logs
- Conduct accessibility audits (VoiceOver/TalkBack, contrast, font scaling)
- Coordinate regression suite automation with Frontend Developer
- Gate beta release with go/no-go criteria (≥90% processing success, <5% crash rate)

## Test Plan Structure

### Test Categories
```yaml
# 1. Functional Tests (80% of effort)
- User Stories: Each acceptance criterion from PRD Section 4 becomes a test case
- CRUD Operations: Projects, Scripts, Videos (create, read, update, delete)
- State Machines: Recording (idle → countdown → recording → paused → reviewing), Processing (uploading → complete)
- Feature Toggles: Subtitles, Filler Removal, Intro/Outro (enabled/disabled combinations)

# 2. Integration Tests (10% of effort)
- End-to-End Flows: Onboard → Create Project → Script → Record → Process → Preview → Export
- API Integration: Upload → Transcription → Composition → Encoding → Download (with vendor fallbacks)
- Offline Mode: Queue uploads, auto-retry on reconnect, graceful degradation

# 3. Non-Functional Tests (10% of effort)
- Performance: Launch times, animation FPS, memory usage, battery drain
- Accessibility: VoiceOver/TalkBack, contrast, font scaling, touch targets
- Security: Permissions handling, data privacy (no cloud uploads), API key safety
```

### Example Bug Report
```yaml
Bug ID: BUG-023
Title: Recording - Teleprompter freezes when WPM changed during playback
Severity: P2 (Major)
Priority: High
Component: Recording / Teleprompter
Environment:
  - Device: iPhone 12
  - OS: iOS 16.5
  - App Version: 1.0.0 (Build 52)
  - Network: WiFi

Pre-conditions:
  - Project created with script (150 words)
  - Recording screen loaded
  - Teleprompter scrolling at 140 WPM (default)

Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Navigate to Record screen
  2. Tap Play on teleprompter (scrolling starts)
  3. While scrolling, drag WPM slider from 140 to 180
  4. Observe teleprompter behavior

Expected Result (per Epic B3):
  - Teleprompter scroll speed updates in real-time
  - Scrolling continues smoothly at new WPM (180)
  - No visual glitches or freezes

Actual Result:
  - Teleprompter freezes for ~2 seconds after WPM change
  - Scroll position resets to top of script
  - User must tap Restart to resume scrolling

Reproducibility: Always (10/10 attempts)

Attachments:
  - Video: [bug-023-teleprompter-freeze.mp4]
  - Logs: [React DevTools console shows "Cannot update during render" warning]

Additional Notes:
  - Root Cause Hypothesis: WPM slider triggers state update during scroll animation, causing re-render
  - Workaround: Pause teleprompter before adjusting WPM, then resume
  - Impact: Frustrating UX during recording, may cause users to retake videos
  - Related: Epic B3 (plan.md), Teleprompter scroll animation logic

```yaml
# Run before every beta build (15 min manual test)
- [ ] App launches without crash (iPhone 12, Pixel 7)
- [ ] Onboarding completes and saves niche
- [ ] Create project → Project appears in list
- [ ] Record 10s video → Raw video saves locally
- [ ] Preview raw video → Video plays
- [ ] Enable 1 feature → Processing starts (wait 30s, then cancel)
- [ ] Export processed video (from previous test) → Share sheet opens
- [ ] VoiceOver/TalkBack: Navigate 3 screens, all labels present
- [ ] Offline mode: Disconnect network → Banner appears
- [ ] Crash rate: Check Sentry, <5% over last 24h
```
